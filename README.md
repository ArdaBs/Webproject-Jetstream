# Webproject-Jetstream

This project was created during the ICT Module 294 and marks my first experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As part of a 2-person team, I had the opportunity to develop and implement a comprehensive project. My partner couldn't actively participate in the project due to time constraints, so I had to take full responsibility, despite my initial inexperience in web development.

**About the Project:**

The aim of this project was to create a website for the company Jetstream-Service, which performs ski service work during the winter season. The challenge was to create a responsive website with an online registration option for service orders. The project included the creation of an engaging landing page, a contact page, and an online registration form.

**Challenges and Learnings:**

Despite the initial difficulties and lack of experience, I was able to successfully complete the project. The website may not be perfect, but it serves its purpose. During the project, I gained valuable experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and deepened my interest in web development.

**What I've Learned:**

- Basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Responsive web design
- Form validation
- Project management and time management

**Backend Provided:**

It's important to note that the backend for this project was already provided, which allowed me to focus on the frontend development and user interface.

I'm proud of what I've accomplished and see this project as a stepping stone for my future development in web development. I look forward to learning more about HTML, CSS, and, most importantly, JavaScript, and continuously improving my skills in this area.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
